# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to chose a data set and review earthquake data. I chose a dataset of earthquakes within the last 7 days and used leaflet to plot the earthquakes based on depth and magnitude of each.

## About

This project was designed to give a visual representation of earthquake data in the last week. The problem at hand allowed us to practice our javascript skills while exploring the leaflet libraries available to us. 


## Contributing
leaflet documentation --> helped to understand libraries and calls to different layers
Classwork --> helped with syntax for each step and the coding needed for any html or css adjustments. I also used class examples to help build the layers of the map and the markers
stackoverflow --> for guidance and examples to create the legend. I struggled with getting the colors to show up
